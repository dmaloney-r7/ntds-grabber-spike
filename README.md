This Repo is just a Proof of Concept staging ground.

This work is to create a C-based parser for NTDS.dit that can grab out account data and hashes. It is based, in part, on the research outlined in http://ntdsxtract.com/downloads/ntdsxtract/ntds_forensics.pdf

The code in this repo is a standalone Proof of Concept to lay the groundwork for a Meterpreter extension that will add this functionality.
